        <p>The Earth is constantly changing. Have you ever wondered why most of the world`s volcanoes and 
          earthquakes are concentrated in specific zones? Why does the Philippines have so many active volcanoes? 
          In this lesson, you will learn about the theory that explains the distribution of volcanoes, earthquakes, 
          and mountain ranges — Plate Tectonic Theory.</p>
        <p>After this lesson, you should be able to <strong><em>describe and relate the distribution of active volcanoes, 
          earthquake epicenters, and major mountain belts to Plate Tectonic Theory. (S10ES – Ia-j-36.1)</em></strong></p>

            <p>The Philippines is situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region renowned for its intense geological activity, 
              characterized by the movement of tectonic plates. This is why we frequently experience earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, 
              and the formation of mountain ranges. These events are directly linked to the structure and behavior of Earth`s lithosphere, 
              which comprises the crust and the rigid upper mantle.</p>
            <p>Before we explore these concepts further, let`s activate your prior knowledge about Earth`s structure, earthquakes, 
              and volcanoes — topics you studied in Grades 8 and 9. </p>

            <p><strong><em>Layers of the Earth</em></strong></p>
            <p>Earth is divided into four major layers: the <em>crust, mantle, outer core,</em> and <em>inner core.</em> Each layer has distinct properties. 
              The crust and the uppermost part of the mantle comprise the lithosphere, a rigid layer that can break under stress. The lithosphere 
              is broken into large and small sections, called tectonic plates, that interact and create the tectonic activities on Earth.</p>
            <p>Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The <em>asthenosphere</em> is approximately 180 km thick and comprises hot, molten rocks, also known as magma. 
              The asthenosphere can deform and reshape because of the hot, molten mantle, which circulates as convection currents. These convection currents are 
              generated when the hot lower mantle moves upward, displacing the cooler materials from the upper mantle, which then move downward. This mechanism 
              of heat transfer drives the movement of tectonic plates. These movements, together with the movement of magma to the surface, generate earthquakes 
              and form mountains, volcanoes, islands, trenches, and mid-ocean ridges.</p>

            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.1 Convection currents in the mantle</p>
            <p>The outermost layer of Earth where life exists is called the crust. The crust that makes up the continents is called the continental crust and is about 
              40 to 70 km thick. It is made up of light granitic rocks, mostly made up of aluminum silicates. The crust that underlies the ocean floor is called the 
              oceanic crust and is about 7 to 10 km thick. It is composed of dense basaltic rocks made up of magnesium silicates</p>
            <p>These differences explain why continental crust forms elevated landmasses like continents, while oceanic crust lies beneath ocean basins.</p>

            <p>Beneath the crust is a semisolid, rocky, and very hot layer called the <em>mantle.</em> It is approximately 2900 km thick and accounts for 80 percent 
              of the Earth's mass and most of its volume. The mantle is composed of ferro-magnesium silicate rocks. Its top layer has a temperature of about 900°C. 
              As one goes deeper into the mantle, the temperature increases from 1000°C to 3700°C.</p>
            <p>The core has two layers: the liquid <em>outer core</em> and the solid <em>inner core.</em> The outer core is Earth's only liquid layer, made up of molten nickel and iron. 
              It is approximately 2270 km thick and has a temperature range of 3700°C to 4300°C. The inner core has a diameter of roughly 1,220 km and is primarily 
              composed of solid iron. The inner core is extremely hot, estimated to be about 6000°C.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong><em>Mapping the Inner Earth</em></strong></p>
            <p>As you have learned in your Grade 8 Earth Science, scientists inferred the different layers of Earth by analyzing seismic waves created by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, 
              and other tectonic processes. Knowledge of how seismic waves behave has allowed scientists to learn the composition, density, and properties of Earth's layers. These seismic 
              waves are detected by highly sensitive instruments called seismometers and recorded by seismographs.</p>
            <p>The two types of seismic waves are body waves and surface waves. Body waves travel through the inner layers of the planet, while surface waves only travel on the surface. 
              Although surface waves are important in other aspects of geological studies such as earthquake damages and perceived earthquake strength, they do not provide information about Earth's interior.</p>
            <p>During an earthquake, two types of body waves radiate in all directions: the primary waves and the secondary waves.</p>
            <p>Primary waves, or P waves, are the first to be felt on Earth's surface. They travel at speeds between 1.5 and 8 km/s. P waves are compressional waves; they shake the ground 
              back and forth in the same direction the wave is moving. P waves pass through solid and liquid sections of Earth but refract or bend as they pass through liquids.</p>
            <p>Secondary waves, or S waves, are transverse waves. They move particles in an up-and-down motion and move perpendicular to the direction of the wave. S waves do not travel 
              through liquids. The outer core was discovered to be liquid using this principle. S waves travel about 60 to 70 percent more slowly than P waves.</p>

            <p>Earth may appear as a solid, steady, and unchanging sphere of rock, but it is constantly undergoing minor or major changes externally and internally. Several theories have 
              been proposed to explain changes such as the formation of different landforms, separation of continents, formation of new ocean floor, and movement of the lithospheric plates.</p>
            <p>Earth began as a single landmass or supercontinent called Pangaea. The term comes from the Greek words pan which means "all" and gaea which means "Earth." Pangaea literally 
              translates to "all of Earth" or "all lands." It was surrounded by a vast sea or superocean called Panthalassa, which means "all seas." You will learn more about Earth's early oceans in chapter 3.</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that today's continents were once joined together and gradually drifted apart as a result of tectonic forces. These continents are cradled by continental 
              tectonic plates on the lithosphere. Figure 5 shows the sequence of how Pangaea broke up over time from one massive supercontinent into the seven continents.</p>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.5 How Pangea broke apart</p>
            <p>One of the earliest theories on the changing geography and surface topography of Earth was the contraction theory, which was proposed in the early twentieth century. This theory 
              suggested that as Earth cooled after its formation, its surface contracted and wrinkled, with these wrinkles being the mountain ranges on Earth's surface. Furthermore, the theory also</p>
            <p>assumed that all other features on Earth were formed during a single cooling event and that the planet was relatively static, without any significant change since the cooling (and wrinkling) slowed to a halt.</p>
            <p>The contraction theory was superseded by the theory of continental drift proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. It asserted that there once existed a single large landmass or supercontinent 
              he called Pangaea. Wegener's theory was based upon his observations which included the following:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>The apparent fit of the eastern coastline of South America and western coastline of Africa</li>
              <li>Similarities of plant and animal fossils in South America and some parts of the African continent, which were separated by a vast oceans. </li>
              <li>Similarities in the sequences of rock layers of opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pangaea would later break into two smaller supercontinents, Gondwana and Laurasia. These two supercontinents further split into smaller landmasses. Gondwana is now the present-day Africa, 
              Antarctica, South America, Australia, and the subcontinent of India. It was first hypothesized by Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in the mid-1800s. Laurasia was the precursor to Asia, 
              North America, and Europe. It was coined by South African geologist Alexander du Toit in 1937. The theory of continental drift was rejected because Wegener failed to provide compelling 
              evidence for the mechanism that drives the movement of plates. About half a century after his death, advancements in science enabled further studies and paved new ways to study tectonic movements. 
              These new studies and information led to the verification and improvement of Wegener's initial theory, cementing his legacy as one of the pioneers of plate tectonics.</p>
            <p>In the 1960s, American geologist Harry Hess proposed the seafloor spreading theory, which states that the seafloors or ocean floors-not the continents-move and carry the continents along. 
              Seafloor spreading occurs at the divergent plate boundaries or along mid-ocean ridges. As the plates move away from each other, hot magma from underneath are pushed by the mantle convection. 
              This provides new materials that becomes part of the seafloor and the crust.</p>
            <div class="image">
              <img src="images/lesson1-images/image011.png" alt="Seafloor - spreading">
            </div>
            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.6 Seafloor - spreading</p>
            <p>The theory of plate tectonics, simply put, incorporates the continental drift theory and the seafloor spreading theory. Plate tectonics explains that Earth's lithosphere is composed of many 
              independent massive slabs of solid rocks, or plates, which floats on an inner pliable mantle. This movement is due to the convection currents beneath the plates. The convection currents are driven 
              by the molten outer core and decay of radioactive elements underneath Earth. With the discovery of the spreading oceans (through the seafloor spreading theory) the ocean floor is continually moving 
              and constantly regenerated from a spreading center.</p>
            <p>At present, there are 15 major tectonic plates that consist of seven primary plates and eight secondary smaller plates. The primary plates are the Eurasian Plate, Australian Plate, Pacific Plate, 
              North American Plate, South American Plate, African Plate, and Antarctic Plate. The secondary plates are the Juan de Fuca Plate, Nazca Plate, Cocos Plate, Caribbean Plate, Philippine Sea Plate, 
              Arabian Plate, Indian Plate, and Scotia Plate. Figure 1-7 shows these major plates.</p>

            <p>A volcano is a rupture in the Earth’s crust where magma (molten rock), gases, and ash escape to the surface. Volcanic activity is most common at convergent and divergent boundaries, 
              though it can also occur at hotspots (isolated volcanic regions within a plate).</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong><em>Earthquakes</em></strong></p>
            <p>Earthquakes are generated by the sudden release of energy from rocks when they break or shift. During an earthquake, energy travels through Earth in the 
              form of seismic waves. The point within Earth where the rocks break and where seismic energy is first released is the focus, or hypocenter. It is found 
              within the fault plane. The point on the crust of Earth directly above the focus is the epicenter.</p>
            <p>The focus of an earthquake is found at different depths and is classified as shallow (10 to 100 km), intermediate (70 to 300 km), or deep (300 km or deeper). 
              Earthquakes from shallow epicenters originate from a much closer distance to Earth's crust. They cause the most damage since energy is more concentrated and 
              seismic waves travel faster over shorter distances in all directions to the surface. The earthquakes are strongest at the epicenter than at any other point on 
              Earth's surface, since it is directly above the source of the rupture.</p>
            <div class="image">
              <img src="images/lesson1-images/image023.jpg" alt="The relative location of focus and epicenter of an earthquake">
            </div>
            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.12 The relative location of focus and epicenter of an earthquake</p>
            <p>Underwater earthquakes associated with oceanic-continental subduction cause a vertical movement of the seafloor. Those greater than magnitude seven and whose 
              focus is less than 30 km produce a significant movement that generates large ocean waves called tsunamis.</p>
            <p>Seismic waves are significant in studying earthquakes. Primary and secondary waves help scientists locate the epicenter of an earthquake. During an earthquake, 
              the seismic waves reach Earth's surface at different times because P waves travel faster than S waves. The difference in their arrival time (recorded by seismograph) 
              is used to help determine the distance of the epicenter. The longer the time interval is, the farther is the earthquake epicenter to a seismographic station.</p>
            <p>Seismic information are used to find the exact location of the epicenter. Using the triangulation method, seismologists use the information recorded from at least 
              three seismographic stations to plot their respective distances and locate the epicenter. </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong><em>Mountain Ranges</em></strong></p>
            <p>Mountains are large landforms that rise well above the ground and have steep slopes and a peak generally higher than a hill. Orogenesis refers to the process of 
              forming mountains and mountain ranges. It involves the collision of plates and forces of compression.</p>
            <p>Tectonic plates may move toward one another and push landmasses upward to form mountains and mountain ranges, which are classified according to their origin and 
              the manner by which they are produced by the different forces within Earth.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Fold Mountains</em></p>
            <p>Fold mountains are formed through plate convergence. When a continental plate is subducted beneath another continental plate, the immense forces of compression 
              fold the crust to develop mountain ranges. The Himalayas in Asia was formed from the collision of the Indian Plate and the Tibetan Plate.</p>

            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.13 Mountain range forms when two continental plates collide</p>
            <p>Mountain ranges can also form when an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continental plate. The Andes Mountain Range in South America formed through this process. Other 
              examples of fold mountain ranges are Pyrenees in Europe and the Rocky Mountains and Appalachians in North America.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Volcanic Mountain Ranges</em></p>
            <div class="image">
              <img src="images/lesson1-images/image027.jpg" alt="The movement of the Pacific plate over a hot spot produced the volcanic islands of Hawaii.">
            </div>
            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.14 The movement of the Pacific plate over a hot spot produced the volcanic islands of Hawaii. <br> Note that volcanoes are progressively older from right to left.</p>
            <p>Volcanic mountain ranges usually have isolated peaks that formed for over thousands or millions of years. These structures are constructed from accumulated lava flows, pyroclasts, and other 
              igneous rocks that piled up over time. This may be produced by a hot spot, which causes the magma to rise up, pushing its way up the crust, and accumulate in large amounts. This is the manner 
              by which the islands of Hawaii were formed, which are actually the summits of volcanoes. The subduction of a tectonic plate also gives rise to volcanic mountain ranges along the edges of another 
              tectonic plate.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Erosion-Formed Mountain Ranges</em></p>
            <p>Erosion-formed mountain ranges do not form because of Earth's internal activity but because of rock erosion or weathering. The Appalachian Plateau in the Eastern United States, for example, 
              is made up of sedimentary rocks and formed as a result of erosion and the movement of thrust faults.</p>

            <p class="image-desc">Figure 1.15.The Appalachian Plateau is a long chain of mountains that were formed <br>as a result of erosion and the movement of thrust faults.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Dome Mountain Ranges</em></p>
            <p>Domes result from the upwarping of tectonic plates and are not accompanied by the collision of plate boundaries. This movement can form isolated and large folds in flat 
              regions, which produce elongated structures in the crust called domes. The Black Hills in western South Dakota, USA is an example.</p>
            <div class="image" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto;">
              <img src="images/lesson1-images/image032.jpg" alt="The Black Hills are composed of elongated granite structures called batholiths.">

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><em>Fault-Block Mountain Ranges</em></p>
            <p>The movement of normal faults causes tensional forces and uplifts large blocks of crust to form fault-block mountains. The displacement of the crust sometimes 
              produces numerous cracks and consequently creates parallel mountain ranges. As the crust forms cracks, the block that slides down because of gravity is called 
              graben, which usually becomes a valley. The crustal blocks that do not slide down are referred to as borsts. Examples of fault-block mountains are the Marinduque 
              mountains in the Philippines and the Sierra Nevada in California and the Teton Range in Wyoming, USA</p>
            <div class="image" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto;">

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong><em>Relationship to Plate Tectonic Theory</em></strong></p>
            <p>The <strong>Plate Tectonic Theory</strong> provides a unifying explanation for the global distribution of volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain ranges. Their concentration along plate 
              boundaries supports the idea that these features are direct consequences of plate interactions:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li><strong>Subduction zones</strong> create volcanic arcs and earthquake zones.</li>
              <li><strong>Transform boundaries</strong> result in strike-slip faults and frequent seismic activity.</li>
              <li><strong>Continental collisions</strong> produce extensive mountain belts.</li>
              <li><strong>Divergent boundaries</strong> allow magma to rise, creating new crust and shallow-focus earthquakes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The theory not only explains the <strong>locations</strong> of these features but also their <strong>origins, mechanisms,</strong> and <strong>patterns</strong> of occurrence. 
              It highlights that the Earth's surface is dynamic and continuously reshaped by the movement of tectonic plates.</p>

            <p>Understanding the Earth's structure and the dynamic processes beneath and on its surface helps us make sense of the changes in landforms, 
              the occurrence of natural phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanoes, and the movements of continents. Below is a summary of the key 
              concepts and insights gained from this lesson:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Layers of the Earth:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Earth has four major layers: crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.</li>
              <li>The lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost mantle and is broken into tectonic plates.</li>
              <li>Beneath the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer that allows plate movement through convection currents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Crust:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Continental crust: thick (40–70 km), light, granitic, and composed of aluminum silicates.</li>
              <li>Oceanic crust: thinner (7–10 km), dense, basaltic, and composed of magnesium silicates.</li>
              <li>The crust is the outermost layer where life exists.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Mantle:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>About 2,900 km thick and makes up 80% of Earth’s volume.</li>
              <li>Composed of ferro-magnesium silicates; temperature increases with depth from ~900°C to 3700°C.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Core:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Outer core: liquid layer of molten nickel and iron, ~2,270 km thick, with temperatures from 3700°C to 4300°C.</li>
              <li>Inner core: solid iron, extremely hot (~6000°C), ~1,220 km in diameter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Discontinuities in Earth’s Interior:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Mohorovičić (Moho): boundary between crust and upper mantle.</li>
              <li>Gutenberg: boundary between lower mantle and outer core.</li>
              <li>Lehmann: boundary between liquid outer core and solid inner core.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Seismic Waves and Earth’s Interior:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Earth’s internal layers are studied through seismic waves.</li>
              <li>P waves travel through solids and liquids; S waves travel only through solids.</li>
              <li>Seismometers and seismographs detect and record these waves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Plate Tectonics:</strong></p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Earth's lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates that move due to mantle convection.</li>
              <li>Plate movement creates landforms like mountains, volcanoes, and ocean ridges.</li>
              <li>The theory of continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, introduced the concept of Pangaea.</li>
              <li>Seafloor spreading, proposed by Harry Hess, explains the movement of oceanic plates at mid-ocean ridges.</li>
            </ul>
