## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Download or Copy All Files**

   Make sure you have all `.html`, `.css`, and `.jpg/.png` image files on your device. Keep the folder structure intact.

2. **Open the Website**

   Double-click or open `sidlak.html` in your browser. This is your homepage.

3. **Navigation**

   - Use the navigation bar in the header to move between sections and pages.
   - Some links (like **FAQ**, **About**, and **References**) will scroll to specific sections in `sidlak.html`.
   - Clicking a lesson (Lesson 1–5) will load that lesson's dedicated HTML page (e.g., `lesson1.html`).

4. **Smooth Scrolling**

   The website uses smooth scrolling when moving between sections within the same page. This is enabled via CSS.

5. **Stay Offline**

   No internet connection is needed. All content, including images and styles, is stored locally.
