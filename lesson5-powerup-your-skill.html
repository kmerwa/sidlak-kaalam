  <h1>Lesson 5: Evidence of Plate Movements</h1>
  <h3>Power Up Your Skill!</h3>
  <p><strong>Drifting Evidence Challenge!</strong></p>
  <div class="instructions">
    <strong>How to Play:</strong><br>
    Read each paragraph carefully.<br>
    For each numbered blank, select the best word or phrase from the choices provided to complete the sentence accurately.<br>
    Fill in all the blanks to demonstrate your knowledge of the different lines of evidence for continental drift and plate tectonics.

  <div class="paragraph">
    Alfred Wegener, a German polar researcher, proposed the (1)
    <select></select>
    Drift Theory in 1912, suggesting that continents are slowly drifting around the Earth. He hypothesized that all continents were once a single large landmass called (2)
    <select></select>, a Greek word meaning "All Earth." One line of evidence Wegener observed was how the eastern border of South America and the western part of Africa seemed to fit together like a giant (3)
    <select></select>. He gathered various (4)
    <select></select> of evidence to support his theory, including geological "fit" and fossil evidence, though he didn't personally collect the fossils.

    <br><br>
    Beyond the matching coastlines, (5)
    <select></select> "fit" evidence showed that rock terrains on separate continents also align. For example, the Appalachian Mountains in North America are linked with the (6)
    <select></select> Highlands, and the Karoo system in South Africa matches the Santa Catarina system in Brazil. Another key line of evidence was (7)
    <select></select> evidence, with land-dwelling animals like the Mesosaurus, Cynognathus, and Lystrosaurus found on continents now separated by vast oceans, suggesting they couldn't have (8)
    <select></select> across. The presence of the plant Glossopteris in all southern continents also indicated a past connection.

    <br><br>
    The Continental Drift Theory gained further support with the discovery of (9)
    <select></select> spreading by Harry Hess. Hess's observations of the seafloor, utilizing SONAR technology, revealed new seafloor generated at mid-ocean ridges and destroyed at (10)
    <select></select> zones. A significant line of evidence supporting seafloor spreading came from the symmetrical patterns of (11)
    <select></select> reversal on either side of the mid-oceanic ridge, where rocks of the same age showed identical magnetic polarities. By the 1970s, the concept evolved into (12)
    <select></select> tectonics, recognizing that entire plates of the Earth's crust, including continents, are in motion.
